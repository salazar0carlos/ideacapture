## Full Description

### Overview

**IdeaCapture** transforms the way you manage ideas. Whether you're an entrepreneur with the next big startup, a product manager brainstorming features, or a creator developing content, IdeaCapture helps you capture fleeting thoughts, develop them deeply, and validate their potential—all powered by cutting-edge AI.

### The Problem

Brilliant ideas come at unexpected moments—during a walk, in the shower, or right before sleep. Most people lose these ideas because:
- Writing them down takes too long
- Notes apps become cluttered graveyards
- No structure for developing raw thoughts
- No objective way to evaluate potential
- Ideas scattered across different tools

### The Solution

IdeaCapture provides a complete system:

1. **Voice-First Capture**: Speak your idea naturally with one tap. Real-time waveform visualization shows you're being heard. No more fumbling with keyboards.

2. **AI-Powered Refinement**: Claude AI asks you 5 targeted questions to develop your idea. Cover problem, solution, market, feasibility, and implementation in minutes, not hours.

3. **Market Validation**: Get objective analysis with three scores (Demand, Competition, Feasibility). Clear recommendation: should you pursue this? What are the next steps?

4. **Beautiful Organization**: Categories, statuses, and mind map visualization. See patterns, track progress, and focus on what matters.

5. **Install Anywhere**: PWA technology means native app experience on iPhone, Android, or Desktop. No app store approvals. No platform fees.
